I put together some code to work with 101 SAS users who attend Local SAS User Group Events

Typically this is code we work thru as a group and see how far each person can get.

Start with the first task and keep going as far as you can go.
The code and examples include some minor edit errors that will help you learn when the code fails and you FIX IT.
